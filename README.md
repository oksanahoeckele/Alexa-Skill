This Alexa Skill helps Spanish speakers improve their pronunciation skills in English. Alexa is connected with a rails app through an API that would allow the instructor (admin) to log in and make changes on the site, and automatically update Alexa. I used node.js, javascript, ruby on rails, ruby, jquery, html, css, AWS. Visit my xlearn_Alexa_app on github and x-learn.co for more information.
